## Purpose of the Project

Our school [currently] utilizes the archaic system of keeping students' attendance in track with using Stamping papers, which sometimes also causes issues to the student's end like Missing Attendance Sheets, and extremely long waiting lines due to how the stamping methods really takes a few seconds more.

A few seconds more we can save is very beneficial to shorten the delays of keeping students in track.

This also reduces manpower required since usually, you would need few or more student/teacher staffs to process the attendance slips.

Now with this system, it hopes to reduce the lines taken and also specifically people needed to process hundreds or thousands of students wanting to get their attendance slips get stamped
