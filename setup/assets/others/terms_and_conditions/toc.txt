OpenAttendance Terms and Conditions

Effective Date: November 28, 2025

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using or deploying the OpenAttendance software ("the Software"), developed and maintained by an independent developer (referred to as "we," "us," or "the Developer"). By obtaining, examining, or running the Software, you ("the End User," "you," or "your organization") agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. Project Overview and Purpose

The OpenAttendance Software is a digital solution designed solely for the purpose of Recording student attendance in school times and events digitally.

2. Licensing, Cost, and Donations

Free Use: The Software is provided free of charge under an open-source license.

Donations: While the Software is free to use, donations are accepted and greatly appreciated to support the project's maintenance. A sponsor button is available on the official GitHub repository for this purpose.

3. End User Rights and Permissions (Conditions of Use)

We grant the End User the following rights, provided they comply with all other sections of these Terms:

Right

Description

Free Will Use

You may use, install, and deploy the Software at your free will within your organization.

Code Examination

You are permitted to examine the source code. Note that submitting changes (Pull Requests) and reviewing requires a GitHub account.

Rebranding

You are permitted to modify and rebrand the Software to integrate and fit seamlessly with your existing school system's identity.

Redistribution

Redistribution of the modified or unmodified source code is allowed, subject to the conditions in Section 5.

4. Recommendations and Disclaimer of Liability

We strongly recommend the following practices:

Intranet Deployment: We recommend running the service only within your school's INTRANET (local network) to limit external exposure.

Action Analysis: Even though we grant free will in use, please thoroughly analyze and perform due diligence on your actions and system configurations before applying them to the OpenAttendance system to prevent mishaps or data corruption.

4.1. Security and Data Breach Disclaimer

Network Security Audit: The End User is required and expected to perform regular network security audits and inspections.

Liability: OpenAttendance is not liable or responsible for any student credential or data breach that occurs due to negligence in network security, system configuration, or environmental factors outside the direct control of the core OpenAttendance code.

Certificates: We do not provide security certificates (e.g., SSL/TLS). If you plan to expose the application to the wider internet, you must deploy the necessary security tools and certificates independently.

4.2. Third-Party Software Disclaimer

Tailscale Endorsement: We endorse the use of Tailscale for secure routing and the establishment of a private network (Tailnet) for enhanced security.

Non-Partnership: We are not partnered with Tailscale, and the use of their or any other specific routing or networking method is not enforced. The End User is free to use any routing method they deem suitable.

4.3. Data Transfer and Migration

Data Transfer Tools: We do not provide any tools whatsoever to transfer student data out of the Software's database.

Migration Recommendation: If your organization plans to cease using the Software for reasons such as system upgrades or finding an alternative, we recommend the End User consult the documentation or help requests of the alternative system to initiate data transfer.

5. Maintenance, Warranty, and Bug Reporting

5.1. Limited Maintenance and Support

Zero-Budget, Independent Maintenance: Please be advised that this project originates from an independent developer and is being maintained with zero budget.

Bug Resolution: As a result, bugs and feature requests may be addressed slowly.

5.2. Warranty Disclaimer

Zero Warranty: The Software is provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Software has zero warranty.

5.3. Bug Reporting Requirements

If you encounter a bug, you are required to provide comprehensive details to aid in diagnosis. This includes, but is not limited to:

System Structure: Details of the system's structure, especially if the End User has modified the source code.

Environment: The operating system (OS), when the Software was installed, and the version of Node.js and npm used.

Database: The specific database used (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Execution: The exact commands used to run the Software.

Containerization: If deployed in a containerized environment (e.g., Proxmox, Docker, Kubernetes).

External Tools: Any tools outside the OpenAttendance system that have an effect on its operation (e.g., systemd configuration for auto-execution at boot).

6. Redistribution and Independent Forks

Redistribution Allowed: Redistribution of the Software is permitted.

Independent Forks: If a maintainer forks the project and develops it independently, then the original OpenAttendance Terms no longer govern that distributed copy. It is the other maintainer's clause and license that dictates the distribution's limitations and terms.

7. Compliance and Data Protection

Protective Measures: The End User should exercise protective measures, including data backups and restricted access, to any content or data created by the End User using this Software to prevent malicious breaches.

Jurisdictional Compliance: If your organization operates in the United States or the European Union (EU), you must follow the protocols, laws, and regulations of your state or nation (e.g., GDPR, COPPA) in addressing security measures, data handling, and student privacy.

8. Operating System Compatibility

Original Distribution: Please be reminded that the copy of the OpenAttendance Software is originally distributed for Linux systems.

Porting Risks: Any port or deployment besides Linux (e.g., Windows, macOS) may guarantee unexpected behavior and is done at the End User's risk.
